My though process is to make something that may be a little inefficient but can brute force its way through the tests. Thus, I just used a loop to go through each letter and find how many groups of STR come from each letter in the sequence and set maxlen equal to the maximum of that. I got most of my test cases, but testLargest comes out with an error of Range out of bounds |
| Oct 16 |   6-7pm    | I think I fixed the Range out of bounds error, but I'm now getting a forever loop in testLargest. I'm going to change my code now to not use String.substring() and String.equals(), which should speed it up a lot. More importantly, I added a section at the end which fast forwards i (the variable that keeps track of which letter we are processing) to the end of the subsequence we just processed, so we don't have to repeat so many useless checks. Lastly, I added variables seqlen and strlen so that I don't have to keep calculating sequence.length() and STR.length() over and over again, which takes time. |
