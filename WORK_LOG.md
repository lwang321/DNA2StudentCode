My though process is to make something that may be a little inefficient but can brute force its way through the tests. Thus, I just used a loop to go through each letter and find how many groups of STR come from each letter in the sequence and set maxlen equal to the maximum of that. I got most of my test cases, but testLargest comes out with an error of Range out of bounds |
| Oct 16 |   6-7pm    | I think I fixed the Range out of bounds error, but I'm now getting a forever loop in testLargest. I'm going to change my code now to not use String.substring() and String.equals(), which should speed it up a lot. More importantly, I added a section at the end which fast forwards i (the variable that keeps track of which letter we are processing) to the end of the subsequence we just processed, so we don't have to repeat so many useless checks. Lastly, I added variables seqlen and strlen so that I don't have to keep calculating sequence.length() and STR.length() over and over again, which takes time. |

Basically I turn each unique sequence of chars to be convertable into a hash (integer value) so that I can have constant time comparison. Then, by using a sliding window approach where I subtract one character and add the next, I can increment my hash in constant time and compare in constant time, giving me an algorithm runtime of O(N) where N is the length of the sequence string. However, this program doesn't yet work for testLargest. |

I think my error is either the start or the end, which I fixed for my 10 a's case. However, I'm still off by 9 for testLargest (999991 vs 1000000). |
| Oct 26 |   6-7pm    |                                                                                                             I'm trying a new solution (testtricky solution) with the sliding/matching states to see if it'll get rid of my testlargest problem as well. I just finished it (basically my new algorithm is every time I match and I've been matching, I increment by STRLen, and if I don't match I go back by STRLen. Otherwise, if I haven't been matching, if I matched, go forward by STRLen and reset count, otherwise go forward by 1.) This passed testLargest but I still need to pull testTricky in class w/ Mr Blick. |

It didn't work at first (returning 0 instead of 4) but there was just a simple bug in my code where I had a < instead of <=, which made my sequence hash go way over the integer limit and never equal to the STR hash. I got everything working now. |
